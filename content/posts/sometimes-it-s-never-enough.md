Hi world, 

It's me, Shugofa. Leo made me this blog when we were dating and I really appreciate it. I've been a bit under the weather lately because I think I just feel so ridiculous. What if I'm not making the right decisions? I want to be able to take my power back from things I can't change. I keep looking back at the past with longing eyes. Nothing can change now but the present, but I feel so vulnerable. I make rash decisions. All I want is to be loved, but most of this stems from low self confidence. I sometimes feel that I'm never good enough. I don't need outside validation for that, but I realized that when I came back from Germany, it was like this huge wound opened back up and I'm trying to learn to heal. You can only heal with daily action, and I want some of this daily action to be transcribed here on this blog. I want to make the people that love me proud. Why is it so hard to speak up for myself without sounding so stupid?

I'm turning 25 in 19 days, yet I don't even feel like I've grown. I understand I have to be positive, but I feel my world is crumbling. Everytime a problem comes up, I run. I don't try hard enough to improve. I tried for a bit, but it took a lot of emotional support from my peers to change my attitude. Now, I have to do it for myself. I owe myself this chance. It's really affecting my relationships with other people. 

I'm dating and it's becoming hard to understand what my needs are and what the other person's needs are. I used to get panic attacks and I still do from time to time. I could feel my chest close and my breathing would shorten, until the feeling of being overwhelmed would trigger a burst of tears. I want to be happy, so why can't I be? I feel like everyone around me hates me, because I just hurt them. As I'm writing this, I want Leo to know that I'm sorry for the pain I caused him and I really loved you. It was the happiest and most painful time in my life. I need to move on, but I want you to know I'M SORRY.
