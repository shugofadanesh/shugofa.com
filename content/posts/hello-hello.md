About Me:

Graduating from English Literature last December was an accomplishment. Four gruesome, nail-biting years brought me to an hiatus of my usually working/studying self. Now, I am pursuing classes that have nothing to do with my field in order to expand my options for my future. The month of January I saw a huge amount of overspending via the following :

Paying for 3 Graduate Studies Applications : \~330$

Subscribing to a Journalling app but then not removing myself from the list: \~55$

Paying for mental health healing : 170$

Eating out at a restaurant 5 times : \~ 70$

Metro fares : 20 tickets for $56

Monthly Bus pass : 56$

Purchasing books: 40$

Coffee or tea outside the home : 15$

A lot of these expenses couldâ€™ve been avoided and I am looking into budgeting how much I can spend on leisure after I secure a job.

Adulting is hard but you gotta make some dough before you can make a cake.
