Tears soak my pillow

salt water ocean

I wish we had dropped everything and ran like we did that day up that dune of sand - carefree

under the beating sun,

My legs like toothpicks trudging along

One hand holding my hat in place

The most important thing was being in that magical moment 

Of breath and life
