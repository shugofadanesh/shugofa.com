My ex-boyfriend Leo made me this blog, and I think he really got to know me in the short time we were together. He was a super positive spark in my life. Everything shone when we were in Freiburg.

I realize I have to move forward with my writing. After our relationship broke off due to stressful circumstances, I lost my voice. I truly did. But it's here now and I can say, "Hi world, it's me Shug! I'm back from the graveyard of unwritten words that I dug out of the love grave." Self-love, love for others..it's all the same in the end. I can't love other people if I can't love myself. 

I'm taking the necessary steps to improve myself. I'm looking up free counseling services that are available to me in Montreal through Face Ã  Face. It's an 8 week program, so I'll call them to see if I'm eligible. 

I called the Suicide Hotline today and was texting this girl named Lily and she was just splendid. After being diagnosed with ADHD, I blamed myself and starting to look back on all the mistakes I made in life instead of moving forward. It was hard. I even thought of popping all the remaining prescription pills I had for my disorder. I told my brother that I was done with life..and that I was googling ways to overdose. 

I realize now that what I can do is reach out for help. 

Today was the first day, I took a cold shower at the gym and it really helped reduce the inflammation of the stress I put myself through. It's hard, but I need better coping strategies. 

I'm grateful to Heather for giving me those wilted flowers from Aldi a couple days after I told her about this horrible trauma I went through. We ate cookies and watched some movie that I can't recall at the moment on my laptop.

On that day, she gave me her time and attention and looking back it means so much to me. It truly does. 

I hope I can blossom on this blog. 

If not for others, then for myself.

Signing off,

Shug
