I’ve spent some months panicking and trying to get as many ideas as I can to lead me to great things. I realize I need to stop thinking so much and just do. I’ve spent a lot of time at the gym and it’s helping me gain control over my emotions. The anxiety is down, the negative thoughts too. I’m happier. 

I’m still having trouble starting mundane tasks such as homework but I’ll set a timer for tomorrow. Just ten minutes, I’ll tell myself. 

I started reading a book this month and it’s a slow read - a Classic, nonetheless I’m going to finish it. I need to finish what I start.

A dear one paid for it. I like it so far. Will post a review when I am available.
