Ariel 

Oh Ariel, sitting high in your tower

Watching the world below

Imprisoned by an old hag

You are shrouded by darkness

Flecked in gold

Oh Ariel, leaning on her windowsill

Murmuring to the owls for comfort

You reach outside, assaulted by crystalline needles that melt in your hands

Reach out, reach high

Oh, Ariel

Do not let your spirit die.

Let it blown by the wind and let it burn in Luciferian fire

What you wish will come true

When you climb down and crawl out of
