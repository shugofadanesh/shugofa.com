I'm sorry world, that I got too close to the edge. 

I'm sorry world, that I almost slipped off the ledge.

Pitiful pathetic plunder.

A hot mess of snot and red hot anger.

Sometimes you walk two steps before you see the dark holes that dig deeper into your skin.

You are in your own cave as you dig deeper into nothingness.

The nothingness that you tell yourself you are.

But you tell yourself, and it is not.

So that must be....negation at work.

All that you are is the complete empty and full rise of the sea.
